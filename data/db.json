It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be they simple or complex.\n\n\nThe Progressive Framework​\nVue is a framework and ecosystem that covers most of the common features needed in frontend development. But the web is extremely diverse - the things we build on the web may vary drastically in form and scale. With that in mind, Vue is designed to be flexible and incrementally adoptable. Depending on your use case, Vue can be used in different ways:\n\nEnhancing static HTML without a build step\nEmbedding as Web Components on any page\nSingle-Page Application (SPA)\nFullstack / Server-Side Rendering (SSR)\nJamstack / Static Site Generation (SSG)\nTargeting desktop, mobile, WebGL, and even the terminal\nIf you find these concepts intimidating, don't worry! The tutorial and guide only require basic HTML and JavaScript knowledge, and you should be able to follow along without being an expert in any of these.\n\nIf you are an experienced developer interested in how to best integrate Vue into your stack, or you are curious about what these terms mean, we discuss them in more detail in Ways of Using Vue.\n\nDespite the flexibility, the core knowledge about how Vue works is shared across all these use cases. Even if you are just a beginner now, the knowledge gained along the way will stay useful as you grow to tackle more ambitious goals in the future. If you are a veteran, you can pick the optimal way to leverage Vue based on the problems you are trying to solve, while retaining the same productivity. This is why we call Vue \"The Progressive Framework\": it's a framework that can grow with you and adapt to your needs.",
