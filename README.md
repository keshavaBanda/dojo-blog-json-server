# How to run this application to see proper output

## step 1:
First you need to install dependenices then run the code with command npm start.
```
npm install && npm start
```

## step 2:
To see the backend data on UI you need to run below command
```
npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
```

## step 3: 
Reload the page you will see the data which was there in json server. Also you can perform action CRUD(Crate a blog, Read a blog, Delete a blog)
update/patch a blog is available for now. I am going to add those future in upcoming version.
